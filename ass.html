			<center><h1>MY EXPERIENCE IN WEB3BRIDGE TRAINING</h1></center>
			<p>I'm a girl with no experience about web development. A complete novice.</p>
			<p>The experiences I had and still having in Web3bridge has been fun so far. In accordance with the fun of learning new things, there also came challenges. Challenges that are tough and always wants to make you give up especially when everything seems foreign to you, but with God, constant delibrate practices, endurance and patience, I believe I am and will continue to pull through the challenges.</P>
			<p>In this web3bridge training, I am presently participating in the ongoing web2cohortVII and i've been able to learn lot of things like HOW TO BUILD A WEBSITE WITH HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT within just 2 weeks of the training</p>
			<h3>THANK YOU SO MUCH WEB3BRIDGE FOR THE PASSION OF WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT THAT YOU HAVE IMPACTED ON ME</h3> God bless this community.
